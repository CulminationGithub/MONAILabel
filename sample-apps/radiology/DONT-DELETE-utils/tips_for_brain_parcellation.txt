Sliding window hyperparameters and transform for brain parcellation

1/ use the same bacth size for training and inference
2/ padding mode should not be with zeros
3/ the patches shouldn't contain lots of background OR not background at all. Don't use the crop foreground transform for brain parcellation
4/ In sliding window use hte gaussian mode to give priority to the center
5/ Use the same overlap for both training and testing (i.e. 0.5)
6/ use blurring transfor during training to simulate test images
7/ 96x96x96 patch size works great
8/ do the intesnity normalization before the random cropping transform
9/ Norm.INSTANCE works great in UNET. Should we try the batchnormalization?
